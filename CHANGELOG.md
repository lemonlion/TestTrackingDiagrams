## [2.0.152-beta] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- Renamed README title from "Test Tracking Diagrams" to "TestTrackingDiagrams" (PascalCase, matching .NET package naming convention)

## [2.0.151-beta] - 2026-04-18

## [2.0.150-beta] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- Updated NuGet package descriptions across all 15 packages to reflect broader tracking capabilities (HTTP, database, cache, events, and more) instead of just "request-responses"

## [2.0.148-beta] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- Updated README.md to reflect all tracking capabilities beyond HTTP — now covers Cosmos DB, EF Core SQL, Redis, TrackingProxy, and events/messages
- Updated nuget-readme.md with the same broader language
- Revised ASCII architecture diagram to show CosmosDB, SQL DB, Redis, and proxy dependencies alongside HTTP and events
- Replaced HTTP-specific wording in How It Works, Use Cases, and Deterministic vs AI-Generated Diagrams sections with inclusive language covering all tracked interaction types
- Step 1 (Intercept) now uses a table summarising all six tracking mechanisms

## [2.0.139-beta] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- `.editorconfig` for consistent code style enforcement
- `.gitattributes` for cross-platform line ending normalisation

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.1)
- `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability reporting guidance
- NuGet package icon (sequence diagram motif with checkmark)
- XML doc comments on all core public API types: `ReportConfigurationOptions`, `TestTrackingMessageHandlerOptions`, `ComponentDiagramOptions`, `ServiceCollectionExtensions`, `WebApplicationFactoryExtensions`

### Fixed
- Removed copy-pasted `.gitignore` entry referencing unrelated project
- Removed 5 orphaned `Example.Api/` files with unresolved git merge conflict markers
- Removed untracked prototype/PoC files from repository root (`generate-poc.ps1`, `prototype-parameterized-grouping.html`)
- Moved `themes/` directory under `examples/` to match reorganised structure
- Removed internal design documents from tracked `docs/` directory

### Changed
- CI workflows now use committed `global.json` instead of inline SDK pinning

## [2.0.138-beta] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- LightBDD.xUnit3 example: added missing `using TestTrackingDiagrams.LightBDD` for `HappyPathAttribute`, `LightBddTestTrackingMessageHandlerOptions`, and `TrackingDiagramOverride`
- ReqNRoll xUnit2/xUnit3 examples: added `TestTrackingDiagrams.ReqNRoll.Core` to `reqnroll.json` binding assemblies so ReqNRoll discovers `[Binding]` hooks

## [2.0.137-beta] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- Reorganised repository from flat structure into `src/`, `tests/`, `examples/` directories
- Updated all project references and solution file for new structure
